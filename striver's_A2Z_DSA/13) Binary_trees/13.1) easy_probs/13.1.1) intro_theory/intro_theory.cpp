// Binary tree:
// A hierarchical data structure where each node has at most 2 child nodes

// Different types of binary tree:
// 1) Full-binary tree:
// -- All nodes should have either 0 or 2 child nodes
// 2) Complete-binary tree:
// -- All the levels must have complete set of nodes
// -- The last level however could be incomplete with each node at its left most position
// 3) Perfect-binary tree:
// -- All lead nodes are at the same level
// 4) Balanced tree:
// -- Height of the tree at max should be log(N) where N is the number of nodes
// 5) Degenerate tree:
// -- Every node has only one child element essentially forming a single line of tree, similar to linked-list
